RoboHydra is a web server designed to help you test any kind of HTTP,
HTTPS, or WebSockets client:

* GUIs that use a public API,
* Mobile applications that communicate with some server,
* Complex Javascript front-ends that use a server as a data store,
* Server applications that contact 3rd party servers,
* And more! See the [use case comics](/usecases) for more information.

RoboHydra allows you to easily build custom "mock" servers with little
effort, be it to build a test suite or to easily reproduce problems
while fixing bugs. RoboHydra also supports exploratory testing by
allowing you to change its behaviour dynamically via its web
interface.  Last but not least, RoboHydra can also reverse proxy
requests, which is useful in a variety of situations.

Documentation
=============

To get started, go read the [tutorial](docs/tutorial). There are also
a number of screencasts in the [YouTube
channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/robohydra/videos), and [Dev
Opera](http://dev.opera.com) published articles on how to use
RoboHydra for [front-end developer
proxies](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/robohydra-a-new-testing-tool-for-client-server-interactions/)
and [mock
servers](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/using-robohydra-as-a-mock-server/),
and even one on [advanced
techniques](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/robohydra-advanced-techniques/).

For those of you already familiar with RoboHydra, there is also
[reference documentation](docs) available.
